Conclusion: 

As a student working on an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Big Basket's dataset, I've learned a lot about the company's products, pricing, and what customers like to buy. The analysis showed that categories like Beauty & Hygiene and Gourmet & World Food are very popular, with high sales and contributions, meaning customers really like these products. I also noticed some very high prices in the data, which suggests there are premium products that may affect the overall pricing strategy. Additionally, looking at the discounts offered, it became clear that customers are quite responsive to promotions, which can be used strategically to boost sales. 

This project helped me better understand how to use data to make informed business decisions and highlighted the importance of analyzing different parts of a business to find trends and improve performance.
